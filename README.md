# Universal-RC-Transceiver
This project is a high-performance, DIY Radio Control Transmitter designed to be a "Master Remote" for future robotics projects. While the transmitter is a complete hardware build (Universal PCB + 3D Printed Case), the receiver is provided as a reference prototype to jumpstart integration into any Arduino-based vehicle.
