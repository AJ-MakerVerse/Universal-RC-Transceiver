**Transmitter STLs**

This folder contains the 3D-printable files for the transmitter enclosure. The design focuses on ergonomics, ensuring a comfortable grip for long sessions, and easy access to all switches and joysticks.

**STL Files**

* Enclosure - Top.stl: The main faceplate with cutouts for joysticks, buttons, and switches.
* Enclosure - Bottom.stl: The rear shell, designed to house the Universal PCB.
* Potentiometer - Knob.stl: Custom-fit knobs for the two potentiometers (print 2x).
* Button - Cap.stl: Protective caps for the tactile push buttons to improve surface area and feel (pint 3x). 

**Recommended Print Settings**  
For the best fit and durability, use the following settings:

* Material	-	PLA (for ease) or PETG (for durability)
* Layer Height	-	0.2mm
* Infill	-	10% (Lightning)
* Supports	-	None

**Post-Processing**  
If you notice stringing, abrasions, or if the parts aren't meshing perfectly, do some light sanding on the contact edges.

**Assembly**

* PCB Placement: 	Place the assembled Universal PCB/Transmitter unit into the Enclosure - Bottom. Ensure it is seated properly.
* Button Preparation: 	Place the 3 Button Caps into their respective slots in the Enclosure - Top.
* The Snap: 		Align the Enclosure - Top with the Enclosure - Bottom. Press firmly until you hear the parts snap together.
* Potentiometers: 	Screw on the metal nut that came with your potentiometer to secure the electronics to the shell.
* Knobs: 		Press the Potentiometer - Knob over the potentiometer shafts.
* Arduino: 		Finally, insert your Arduino Nano into the female header pins on your board.

**Troubleshooting**

* Tight Fit: If the cap stick, sand the sides down slightly, and ensure they move freely
* Alignment: Ensure that the components are aligned with enclosure's slots.
